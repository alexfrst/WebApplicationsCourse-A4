<h1>Presentation</h1>
    <br/>
    Welcome to my website, here I will talk about me and my formation as an engineer. I hope you will appreciate it.
    <h2>Why datascience</h2>
    I've chosen datascience for the following reasons:
    <ul>
        <li>It is a challenging environment</li>
        <li>We add value to data and provide better service to end-users</li>
        <li>This field keeps growing each year</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>



    <h2>My web experience</h2>
    This is not the first time i've worked on a web site.
    I've worked on a <a href="https://pointage-atelier.herokuapp.com/pointage/">Pointing website</a> to ensure the safety of every member of my association during the covid pandemic
    <br/>
    More recently i've integrated a datascience model in this <a href="https://localhost:8000/prediction/index">website</a> to make  predictions about bankruptcies.
